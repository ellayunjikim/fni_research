abstract = {Over the last two years we have been developing a novel approach, placing science education at the center of a maker technological environment: Make Science. In order to refine our Make Science approach, we have implemented a design-based research method working mostly with elementary and middle school students, in which we repeat the process of developing and applying our educational activities. At the end of the process, we categorized our approach into 5 operating pedagogical principles: introduce science through a multidisciplinary perspective; introduce the aspects of science from basic principles to current scientific research; focus on the "educational process" as the center of learning; emphasize the acquisition of unique learning skills; engage students with "flow" (optimal learning experience). In our paper, we will elaborate in-depth on these principles while referring to a few case studies which took place within our Make Science environment.},

abstract = {Online data privacy draws more and more concerns. Online Social Network (OSN) service providers employ anonymization mechanisms to preserve private information and data utility. However, these mechanisms mostly focus on the traditional definitions about privacy and utility. Recently, both benign data scientists and attackers utilize machine learning methods to extract information from OSNs. This paper aims to present a novel angle of balancing privacy and utility under machine learning. The proposed scheme perturbs the data that breaks the attackers' learning results and protect the benign third parties' learning results. To preserve both privacy and utility, we propose two different anonymization approaches to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The first approach combines the two objectives. It utilizes the deep learning model, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to sequentially learns the two objectives and generates graphs. The second approach analyzes the differences between the two objects on structures. It utilizes Integrated Gradient (IG) in learning to break attackers' learning results. It structurally rewires edges to preserve third parties' learning results afterwards. The experiment results show that both approaches work well in privacy preservation.},

abstract = {In card-based cryptography, the numbers of cards and shuffles are the complexity measures of protocols for secure computations, and the smaller these values are, the better. As the state-of-the-art study to minimize the latter measure, Shinagawa and Nuida showed a surprising result that any n-input logical function can be securely computed with only one shuffle, based on the idea of Yao's garbled circuit. When executing their protocol, the number of required cards is 2n+24q, where the n-input logical function to be computed is represented by q gates. For example, when applied to the n-input AND and XOR functions, the number of gates is n-1, and hence, 26n-24 cards are required. In this paper, we show that the number of required cards can be reduced by focusing on these two specific functions. Specifically, we construct a single-shuffle protocol for the n-input AND function using 4n-2 cards, and construct a single-shuffle protocol for the n-input XOR function using 2n cards.},

Upon receiving any user 's request of computing a function on the data, the server is able to generate both the computation result and a short tag that vouches for the correctness of the result. MKHomMACs provide a solution with minimal communication and interaction to the problem of delegating computations over outsourced data. Fiore, Mitrokotsa, Nizzardo, and Pagnin (Asiacrypt 2016) constructed a PRF-based MKHomMAC where the result verification could be as costly as the delegated computation. In this paper, we show a PRF-based MKHomMAC for quadratic arithmetic circuits such that the verification can be substantially faster than the delegated computation in an amortized setting. The efficiency improvement is achieved by using PRFs with multi-key amortized closed-form efficiency.},

abstract = {State channel network is the most popular layer-2 solution to the issues of scalability, high transaction fees, and low transaction throughput of public Blockchain networks. However, the existing works have limitations that curb the wide adoption of the technology, such as the expensive creation and closure of channels, strict synchronization between the main chain and off-chain channels, frozen deposits, and inability to execute multi-party smart contracts. In this work, we present Speedster, an account-based state-channel system that aims to address the above issues. To this end, Speedster leverages the latest development of secure hardware to create dispute-free certified channels that can be operated efficiently off the Blockchain. Speedster is peer-to-peer decentralized and provides better privacy protection than prior channel projects. It supports fast native multi-party contract execution, which is previously unavailable in TEE-enabled channel networks. Compared to the Lightning Network, Speedster improves the throughput by about 10,000X and generates 97%$ less on-chain data with a comparable network scale.},

abstract = {Anonymous communication, that is secure end-to-end and unlinkable, plays a critical role in protecting user privacy by preventing service providers from using message metadata to discover communication links between any two users. Techniques, such as Mix-net, DC-net, time delay, cover traffic, Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) and Private Information Retrieval, can be used to achieve anonymous communication. SMC-based approach generally offers stronger simulation based security guarantee. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel SMC approach to establishing anonymous communication, easily implementable with two non-colluding servers which have only communication and storage related capabilities. Our approach offers stronger security guarantee against malicious adversaries without incurring a great deal of extra computation. To show its practicality, we implemented our solutions using Chameleon Cloud to simulate the interactions among a million users, and extensive simulations were conducted to show message latency with various group sizes. Our approach is efficient for smaller group sizes and sub-group communication while preserving message integrity. Also, it does not have the message collision problem.},

Currently, the main obstacles for traitor tracing are the deficiency of content-independent data watermarking scheme and the untrustworthiness of third parties. In view of this, we propose the T-Tracer --- an encoding-based watermarking scheme. With T-Tracer, each party of data delivery embeds its digital fingerprint into the byte sequence of the shared data by generating a tailor-made symbol mapping table, whereby the watermarking can handle any type of data. A blockchain network overlaying all data sharing participants serves as a trusted third party to ensure the credibility of T-Tracer. By applying T-Tracer, anyone in the network can recognize the culprits by identifying their fingerprints from the data objects that appear as evidence of data delivery repudiation. The evaluation results show that T-Tracer is effective and practical in improving the credibility of traitor tracing.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks that leak sensitive information through a computing device's interaction with its physical environment have proven to be a severe threat to devices' security, particularly when adversaries have unfettered physical access to the device. Traditional approaches for leakage detection measure the physical properties of the device. Hence, they cannot be used during the design process and fail to provide root cause analysis. An alternative approach that is gaining traction is to automate leakage detection by modeling the device. The demand to understand the scope, benefits, and limitations of the proposed tools intensifies with the increase in the number of proposals. In this SoK, we classify approaches to automated leakage detection based on the model's source of truth. We classify the existing tools on two main parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device and the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing the model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge level across the domain and identify open problems. In particular, we highlight the absence of evaluation methodologies and metrics that would compare proposals' effectiveness from across the domain. We believe that our results help practitioners who want to use automated leakage detection and researchers interested in advancing the knowledge and improving automated leakage detection.},

abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are often vulnerable to semantics-preserving adversarial attacks. That is, they make different semantic predictions on input instances with similar content and semantics. However, it remains unclear to which extent modern NLP models are vulnerable to content-preserving and semantics-flipping (CPSF) adversarial attacks. That is, they would make the same semantic prediction on input instances with similar content but flipped semantics. Attackers can use either semantics-preserving or CPSF adversarial examples to create misunderstanding between humans and models, and incur severe consequences in real-world applications. However, this equally important problem on CPSF adversarial examples has not been studied by researchers yet. In this paper, we perform the first study to investigate CPSF adversarial examples and propose CPSF adversarial attacks to reveal this new type of vulnerability of NLP models. We develop a two-stage approach to generate CPSF adversarial examples. Our experiments on two types of NLP tasks, sentiment analysis and textual entailment, demonstrate that CPSF adversarial examples can successfully fool victim models while preserving the same content with flipped semantics to humans. We further validate the good transferability of CPSF adversarial examples on NLP services of Microsoft and Google. Moreover, we demonstrate that adversarial training can to a meaningful extent mitigate CPSF adversarial attacks. Overall, our work implies that researchers need to improve NLP models' robustness against CPSF adversarial attacks that uniquely exploit the blind spots where NLP models are too insensitive to even big changes in semantics.},

abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is composed by a wide variety of software and hardware components that inherently contain vulnerabilities. Previous research has shown that it takes only a few minutes from the moment an IoT device is connected to the Internet to the first infection attempts. Still, we know little about the evolution of exploit vectors: Which vulnerabilities are being targeted in the wild, how has the functionality changed over time, and for how long are vulnerabilities being targeted? Understanding these questions can help in the secure development, and deployment of IoT networks.We present the first longitudinal study of IoT malware exploits by analyzing 17,720 samples collected from three different sources from 2015 to 2020. Leveraging static and dynamic analysis, we extract exploits from these binaries to then analyze them along the following four dimensions: (1) evolution of infection vectors over the years, (2) exploit lifespan, vulnerability age, and the time-to-exploit of vulnerabilities, (3) functionality of exploits, and (4) targeted IoT devices and manufacturers. Our descriptive analysis uncovers several patterns: IoT malware keeps evolving, shifting from simply leveraging brute force attacks to including dozens of device-specific exploits. Once exploits are developed, they are rarely abandoned. The most recent binaries still target (very) old vulnerabilities. In some cases, new exploits are developed for a vulnerability that has been known for years. We find that the mean time-to-exploit after vulnerability disclosure is around 29 months, much longer than for malware targeting other environments.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of companies are adopting cloud storage technology to reduce overhead. However, to ensure the privacy of sensitive data, the uploaded data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. The concept of public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) was introduced by Boneh et al. to provide flexible usage of the encrypted data. Unfortunately, most of the PEKS schemes are not secure against inside keyword guessing attacks (IKGA), so the keyword information of the trapdoor may be leaked to the adversary. To solve this issue, Huang and Li presented public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) in which the trapdoor generated by the receiver is only valid for authenticated ciphertexts. With their seminal work, many PAEKS schemes have been introduced for the enhanced security of PAEKS. Some of them further consider the upcoming quantum attacks. However, our cryptanalysis indicated that in fact, these schemes could not withstand IKGA. To fight against the attacks from quantum adversaries and support the privacy-preserving search functionality, we first introduce a novel generic PAEKS construction in this work. Then, we further present the first quantum-resistant PAEKS instantiation based on lattices. The security proofs show that our instantiation not only satisfies the basic requirements but also achieves enhanced security models, namely the multi-ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-trapdoor privacy. Furthermore, the comparative results indicate that with only some additional expenditure, the proposed instantiation provides more secure properties, making it suitable for more diverse application environments.},

abstract = {Flash memory has been used extensively as external storage of smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, laptops, etc. Therefore, more and more sensitive or even mission critical data are stored in flash and, once the data turn obsolete, securely deleting them is necessary for both regulation compliance and privacy protection. Traditional secure deletion on flash memory mainly focuses on sanitizing data. However, unique nature of flash memory may cause various data ''remnants'' and, even though the data are removed, the remnants may be utilized by the adversary to recover the deleted data, compromising the secure deletion guarantee.Based on both theoretic analysis and experiments using real-world workloads, we have identified one common type of remnants in the flash memory, namely duplicates, which are caused by unique internal functions of flash storage media including garbage collection, wear leveling, bad block management. We propose RedFlash, a novel secure deletion scheme which can efficiently Remove both the data and the corresponding duplicates towards secure deletion on Flash memory. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that RedFlash can ensure the secure deletion guarantee, at the cost of a small performance degradation, compared to a regular (non-secure) flash controller.},

This raises two important issues: (1) privacy unfairness (i.e., if some subgroups are more vulnerable to MIAs than the others); and (2) defense unfairness (i.e., if the defense mechanisms provide more protection to some particular subgroups than the others).In this paper, we investigate both privacy unfairness and defense fairness.We formalize a new notation of privacy-leakage disparity (PLD), which quantifies the disparate privacy leakage of machine learning models to MIA across different subgroups. In terms of privacy unfairness, our empirical analysis of PLD on real-world datasets shows that privacy unfairness exists. The minority subgroups (i.e., the less represented subgroups) tend to have higher privacy leakage. We analyze how subgroup size and subgroup data distribution impact PLD through the lens of model memorization. In terms of defense unfairness, our empirical evaluation shows the existence of unfairness of three state-of-the-art defenses, namely differential privacy, L2-regularizer, and Dropout, against MIA. However, defense unfairness mitigates privacy unfairness as the minority subgroups receive stronger protection than the others. We analyze how the three defense mechanisms affect subgroup data distribution disparately and thus leads to defense unfairness.},

abstract = {Cross-device tracking has drawn growing attention from both commercial companies and the general public because of its privacy implications and applications for user profiling, personalized services, etc. One particular, wide-used type of cross-device tracking is to leverage browsing histories of user devices, e.g., characterized by a list of IP addresses used by the devices and domains visited by the devices. However, existing browsing history based methods have three drawbacks. First, they cannot capture latent correlations among IPs and domains. Second, their performance degrades significantly when labeled device pairs are unavailable. Lastly, they are not robust to uncertainties in linking browsing histories to devices.We propose GraphTrack, a graph-based cross-device tracking framework, to track users across different devices by correlating their browsing histories. Specifically, we propose to model the complex interplays among IPs, domains, and devices as graphs and capture the latent correlations between IPs and between domains. We construct graphs that are robust to uncertainties in linking browsing histories to devices. Moreover, we adapt random walk with restart to compute similarity scores between devices based on the graphs. GraphTrack leverages the similarity scores to perform cross-device tracking. GraphTrack does not require labeled device pairs and can incorporate them if available. We evaluate GraphTrack on two real-world datasets, i.e., a publicly available mobile-desktop tracking dataset (around 100 users) and a multiple-device tracking dataset (154K users) we collected. Our results show that GraphTrack substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on both datasets.},

abstract = {Continuous location authentication (CLA) seeks to continuously and automatically verify the physical presence of legitimate users in a protected indoor area. CLA can play an important role in contexts where access to electrical or physical resources must be limited to physically present legitimate users. In this paper, we present WearRF-CLA, a novel CLA scheme built upon increasingly popular wrist wearables and UHF RFID systems. WearRF-CLA explores the observation that human daily routines in a protected indoor area comprise a sequence of human-states (e.g., walking and sitting) that follow predictable state transitions. Each legitimate WearRF-CLA user registers his/her RFID tag and also wrist wearable during system enrollment. After the user enters a protected area, WearRF-CLA continuously collects and processes the gyroscope data of the wrist wearable and the phase data of the RFID tag signals to verify three factors to determine the user's physical presence/absence without explicit user involvement: (1) the tag ID as in a traditional RFID authentication system, (2) the validity of the human-state chain, and (3) the continuous coexistence of the paired wrist wearable and RFID tag with the user. The user passes CLA if and only if all three factors can be validated. Extensive user experiments on commodity smartwatches and UHF RFID devices confirm the very high security and low authentication latency of WearRF-CLA.},

abstract = {Modern commercial antivirus systems increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) to keep up with the rampant inflation of new malware. However, it is well-known that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Previous works have shown that ML malware classifiers are fragile to the white-box adversarial attacks. However, ML models used in commercial antivirus (AV) products are usually not available to attackers and only return hard classification labels. Therefore, it is more practical to evaluate the robustness of ML models and real-world AVs in a pure black-box manner. We propose a black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework to generate AEs for PE malware classifiers and AV engines. It regards the adversarial attack problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, which finds an optimal balance between exploiting the successful patterns and exploring more varieties. Compared to other frameworks, our improvements lie in three points: 1) limiting the exploration space by modeling the generation process as a stateless process to avoid combination explosions, 2) reusing the successful payload in modeling; and 3) minimizing the changes on AE samples to correctly assign the rewards in RL learning (which also helps identify the root cause of evasions). As a result, our framework has much higher evasion rates than other off-the-shelf frameworks. Results show it has over 74%--97% evasion rate for two state-of-the-art ML detectors and over 32%--48% evasion rate for commercial AVs in a pure black-box setting. We also demonstrate that the transferability of adversarial attacks among ML-based classifiers is higher than that between ML-based classifiers and commercial AVs.},

However, there is a lack of studies on the effect of data poisoning attacks against the anomaly based attack detectors that depend on some form of machine learning. In this paper, we introduce some data poisoning attack strategies against anomaly-based attack detectors in smart metering infrastructure and show its impact. Specifically, we propose a whitebox and black box approach to poisoning attacks. Then, we propose modifications to improve the robustness of previous anomaly detection algorithms by modifying certain design choices for learning the thresholds for the anomaly detector. Specifically, we offer theoretical insights and experimental proof to explain why and when they mitigate data poisoning. These design choices include both the regression type and the loss function choice. We measure attack mitigation performance with two NIST specified metrics for CPS systems in the test set using a real smart metering dataset. Finally, we offer recommendations on energy utility's best anomaly detector design choices under varying attack parameters.},

abstract = {Sound waves from speech can potentially induce vibrations, proportional to the speech signal, on nearby objects. Each of these objects introduces the risk for a malicious attacker to exploit the induced vibrations to eavesdrop on the speech. Such an eavesdropping attack is critical when we consider the potential for induced vibrations in standard magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs). As an instance of this threat, prior research has demonstrated that speech in certain scenarios can induce vibrations on the read/write head of an HDD in order to eavesdrop on the speech (Kwong et al.; Oakland'19). In this paper, we revisit this line of research and aim to provide a closer investigation into whether HDDs can in fact be used as a source for eavesdropping on speech vibrations. As a foundation for our study, we utilize an effective, and robust methodology using laser vibrometry to measure the subtle speech vibrations induced on the read/write head. The prior study tested only a single HDD and only machine-rendered speech in a single setting with very loud speech. Our work broadens the scope of this research in many significant ways. First, we test multiple popular HDDs of different models and sizes to evaluate the generalizability of the overall threat. Second, we evaluate the threat from live human speech spoken near an HDD, expanding the scope of the attack to include most real-world speech settings involving normal human conversations. Third, we define machine-rendered speech scenarios to explore different propagation media and degrees of speech loudness. Our findings are two-fold. First, we observed that live human speech traveling through the air is not generally strong enough to impact HDDs such that intelligible speech information is leaked. Second, most tested HDDs did not seem capable of eavesdropping on machine-rendered speech unless the speech is loud enough, or the HDD shares a surface or is in direct contact with the speaker device. This implies HDDs cannot eavesdrop live human speech.},

abstract = {The rocketed population, poor security, and 24/7 online properties make Linux-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices ideal targets for attackers. However, due to the budget constraints and an enormous number of vulnerabilities on such devices, protecting them against attacks is very challenging. Therefore, understanding and detecting IoT malware remote infection, which is before the compromised IoT devices are monetized by adversaries, is crucial to mitigate damages and financial loss caused by IoT malware. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a large-scale dataset covering 403,464 samples collected from VirusShare and a large group of IoT honeypots to gain a deep insight into the characteristics of IoT malware remote infection. We share detailed statistics of shell commands found in our dataset, highlight malicious behaviors performed through those commands, investigate current states of fingerprinting methods of those commands, and offer a taxonomy of shell commands by introducing the notion of infection capability. To demonstrate the usefulness of the knowledge gained from our study, we develop an approach to detect ongoing remote infection activities based on infection capabilities. Our evaluation shows that our detection approach can achieve a 99.22% detection rate for remote infections in the wild and introduce small performance overhead.},

abstract = {Wired serial communication (e.g., UART, I2C) is widely used to exchange information between sensors, actuators, and controllers in automation, control, and cyber-physical systems. In this work, it is demonstrated that intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) can be utilized to not only induce spurious serial communications but to also alter legitimate communications, arbitrarily and at a distance, through attacks that cause controlled, bidirectional bit flips. To prove the efficacy of such attacks, two attack signal types, which require differing levels of attacker knowledge and resources to be effective, are proposed and evaluated against UART and I2C serial communication systems. The first attack waveform, which we call simple, is an inexpensive--to--produce narrowband waveform that has high power and tight timing constraints, but requires little attacker knowledge about the targeted system, while the second waveform, which we call complex, leverages a wideband signal that requires less power to achieve the same effect, is more tolerant of timing error in the signal processing phase, but requires a high amount of attacker knowledge of the targeted system. The simple waveform is shown to be over 98.3% effective at inducing a desired bit sequence into randomly transmitted UART frames, which indicates that an attacker could also choose to inject spurious UART frames, at will. On the I2C data streams, the complex waveform is demonstrated to be overall 75% effective in inducing random bits. Countermeasures are discussed and experimentally validated in high-IEMI scenarios.},

abstract = {Scrubbing sensitive data before releasing memory is a widely accepted but often ignored programming practice for developing secure software. Consequently, confidential data such as cryptographic keys, passwords, and personal data, can remain in memory indefinitely, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to hackers who can retrieve the data using memory dumps or exploit vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed and Etherleak. We propose an approach for detecting a specific memory safety bug called Improper Clearing of Heap Memory Before Release, also known as Common Weakness Enumeration 244, in C programs. The CWE-244 bug in a program allows the leakage of confidential information when a variable is not wiped before heap memory is freed. Our approach combines taint analysis and model checking to detect this weakness. We have three main phases: (1) perform a coarse flow-insensitive inter-procedural static analysis on the program to construct a set of pointer variables that could point to sensitive data; (2) instrument the program with required dynamic variable tracking, and assertion logic for memory wiping before deallocation; and (3) invoke a model checker, the C-Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) in our case, to detect assertion violation in the instrumented program. We develop a tool, toolname, implementing our instrumentation based algorithm, and we provide experimental validation on the Juliet Test Suite --- the tool is able to detect all the CWE-244 instances present in the test suite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which presents a solution to the problem of detecting unscrubbed secure memory deallocation violations in programs.},

In this context, optimizing gas fees in smart contracts becomes necessary to save costs for both developers and users who interact directly with these contracts. To optimize gas, developers typically need to have deep knowledge of blockchain and programming languages, making it a significant challenge for new programmers. In this paper, we introduce GasSaver - an open-source tool that analyzes Solidity-based contracts and suggests modifications to reduce transaction fees. Our tool, which relies on a set of seven rules for identifying non-optimized codes, shows that 6,333 in a total of 10,245 top most interactive contracts on Ethereum contain at least one optimization problem and the total problems are more than 30,000. Hence, the use of this tool can reduce a considerable cost for the deployment and interaction of smart contracts.},

abstract = {SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is the most widely deployed 2FA mechanism, despite the fact that SMS messages are known to be vulnerable to rerouting attacks, and despite the availability of alternatives that may be more secure. This is for two reasons. First, it is very effective in practice, as evidenced by reports from Google and Microsoft. Second, users prefer SMS over alternatives, because text messaging is already part of their daily communication. Accepting this practical reality, we developed a new SMS-based protocol that makes rerouting attacks useless to adversaries who aim to take over user accounts. Our protocol delivers one-time passwords (OTP) via text message in a manner that adds minimal overhead (to both the user and the server) over existing SMS-based methods, and is implemented with only small changes to the stock text-message applications that already ship on mobile phones. The security of our protocol rests upon a provably secure authenticated key exchange protocol that, crucially, does not place significant new burdens upon the user. Indeed, we carry out a user study that demonstrates no statistically significant difference between traditional SMS and our protocol, in terms of usability.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the vulnerability of aircraft communications against low-resourced attackers has received significant attention both in the information security community and from aviation industry and regulators. Until now, research on attacks against such communications technologies has focused on larger aircraft, neglecting the technologies used in light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). As such lighter aircraft make up a large and growing majority of both airspace users and casualties, this is a glaring oversight from a security and safety perspective.To alleviate this problem, we conduct a first comprehensive security analysis of the FLARM ecosystem, a collision avoidance system focusing on light aircraft and UAV with a large and increasing distribution in many countries. Besides being used in more than 40,000 aircraft, several large providers of air traffic data capture the unauthenticated FLARM data using ground receivers in order to feed crucial downstream applications.To show the vulnerability of this ecosystem, we design, implement and evaluate a practical spoofing attack, which is capable of interacting with FLARM receivers in the air and on the ground. The demonstrated attack uses low-cost hardware and open-source software and is as such accessible to a wide range of threat actors, resulting in a significant potential impact on the safety of all airspace users. Finally, in order to counter such attacks, we propose a first anomaly detection approach based on physical-layer characteristics and validate it with real-world aircraft data.},

abstract = {Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) does not provide trapdoor privacy, i.e., keyword information is leaked through trapdoors. To prevent this information leakage, public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) has been proposed, where a sender's secret key is required for encryption, and a trapdoor is associated with not only a keyword but also the sender. Liu et al. (ASIACCS 2022) proposed a generic construction of PAEKS based on word-independent smooth projective hash functions (SPHFs) and PEKS. In this paper, we propose a new generic construction of PAEKS. The basic construction methodology is the same as that of the Liu et al. construction, where each keyword is converted into an extended keyword using SPHFs, and PEKS is used for extended keywords. Nevertheless, our construction is more efficient than Liu et al.'s in the sense that we only use one SPHF, but Liu et al. used two SPHFs. In addition, for consistency we considered a security model that is stronger than Liu et al.'s. Briefly, Liu et al. considered only keywords even though a trapdoor is associated with not only a keyword but also a sender. Thus, a trapdoor associated with a sender should not work against ciphertexts generated by the secret key of another sender, even if the same keyword is associated. Our definition considers a multi-sender setting and captures this case. In addition, for indistinguishability against chosen keyword attack (IND-CKA) and indistinguishability against inside keyword guessing attack (IND-IKGA), we use a stronger security model defined by Qin et al. (ProvSec 2021), where an adversary is allowed to query challenge keywords to the encryption and trapdoor oracles. We also highlight several issues associated with the Liu et al. construction in terms of hash functions, e.g., their construction does not satisfy the consistency that they claimed to hold.},

abstract = {Many IoT devices today talk to each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a wireless communication technology often used to exchange data between a paired central and peripheral. These peripheral devices include not only firmware-defined bare-metal peripherals but also mobile application defined peripherals where a mobile app turns a smartphone into a peripheral instead of their usual central role. However, this role reversal increases the attack surface and brings vulnerabilities in bare-metal Bluetooth peripherals to mobile apps where relevant security and privacy have not been well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents PeriScope, an automated tool to unveil the security and privacy vulnerabilities at the link layer of app-defined Bluetooth peripherals in the procedures of broadcasting, pairing, and communication by systematically analyzing their companion mobile apps. PeriScope has analyzed 1,160 Bluetooth peripheral apps from Google Play and identified 69.13% of them that broadcast device or personal identifiable information in cleartext, and, in addition, there are 95% pieces of data managed by these apps (e.g., personal health data and digital keys to unlock doors) to exchange with connected devices can be accessed without authentication. Finally, a set of guidelines for secure app-defined Bluetooth peripherals development is also provided.},

abstract = {There are increasing calls to introduce coding in K-12 in creative ways that provide opportunities for personal expression. Computational design projects include computational concepts fundamental to computer science to generate 2D and 3D models that can potentially be personally meaningful. We developed and implemented making-based coding activities for youth that combine computational design and 3D printing tools and allow the participants to design and fabricate free-choice projects. To investigate how young persons engaged in computational design and which aspects demotivated them, we used a mixed-methods approach that included semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. We took field notes and collected students’ artifacts to triangulate the data wherever possible. The results show that 3D printing, creating unique aesthetics, enhanced personalization, and ownership of design models are crucial elements for engaging youth in computational design. We discuss the implications of our exploratory study and suggest directions for future work in developing computationally rich making-based activities.},

abstract = {In recent years, the Maker movement has surged in popularity and has become attractive for didactic research. Exploration, creativity, open learning spaces, and problem-orientation are the foundations for successful Maker-Education. While the relevance of Making in higher education is slowly being recognized, it is still uncharted territory for most schools. As part of the “Making at School” project, the Zurich University of Teacher Education, together with the University of Zurich and the CreativeLab Zurich, is committed to creating interdisciplinary modules for Making, e.g., in biology, computer science, or handicraft. The main goal is to help teachers to develop a Maker mindset by providing ideas for designing their own projects. This paper presents a preliminary planning framework that is evaluated by (inter-)national experts in Making. This first assessment shows that the framework is described as useful and appealing, but still too complex to be used in schools.},

abstract = {Voice-activated systems are integrated into a variety of desktop, mobile, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation and replay attacks, in which malicious attackers synthesize the voice of a victim or simply replay it, have brought growing security concerns. Existing speaker verification techniques distinguish individual speakers via the spectrographic features extracted from an audible frequency range of voice commands. However, they often have high error rates and/or long delays. In this paper, we explore a new direction of human voice research by scrutinizing the unique characteristics of human speech at the ultrasound frequency band. Our research indicates that the high-frequency ultrasound components (e.g. speech fricatives) from 20 to 48 kHz can significantly enhance the security and accuracy of speaker verification. We propose a speaker verification system, SUPERVOICE that uses a two-stream DNN architecture with a feature fusion mechanism to generate distinctive speaker models. To test the system, we create a speech dataset with 12 hours of audio (8,950 voice samples) from 127 participants. In addition, we create a second spoofed voice dataset to evaluate its security. In order to balance between controlled recordings and real-world applications, the audio recordings are collected from two quiet rooms by 8 different recording devices, including 7 smartphones and an ultrasound microphone. Our evaluation shows that SUPERVOICE achieves 0.58% equal error rate in the speaker verification task, which reduces the best equal error rate of the existing systems by 86.1%. SUPERVOICE only takes 120 ms for testing an incoming utterance, outperforming all existing speaker verification systems. Moreover, within 91 ms processing time, SUPERVOICE achieves 0% equal error rate in detecting replay attacks launched by 5 different loudspeakers. Finally, we demonstrate that SUPERVOICE can be used in retail smartphones by integrating an off-the-shelf ultrasound microphone.},

abstract = {Advanced cyberattacks are carried out in multiple stages, where each stage performs a specific task corresponding to the campaign. While these steps are designed to blend in with benign activities, they leave their activity footprints across multiple logs on the machines inside the victim environment. The majority of these footprints when looked at in isolation seem benign to the activity monitors. Existing threat hunting systems require a significant amount of human effort to correlate these events in order to detect and reconstruct an attack campaign. This paper introduces SteinerLog, an end-to-end system to automate the task of correlating the alerts to detect ongoing attack campaigns within an enterprise network. SteinerLog takes the alerts generated by mature intelligence-based and anomaly-based alerting systems and uses causal analysis to extract the group of events that are most likely to represent the attackers' activities. It performs hierarchical graph traversal to perform cross-host attacker activity correlation, which includes detecting the compromised entities, reconstructing the attackers' steps, and abstracting them into easy-to-understand attack graphs. The experiments show that it is able to detect APT campaigns in real-time and scale to an enterprise system with hundreds of workstations.},

abstract = {In order to protect user privacy in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), a series of ingeniously designed privacy-preserving frameworks have been proposed. The state-of-the-art approaches adopt Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for linear function and Garbled Circuits (GC)/Oblivious Transfer (OT) for nonlinear operation to improve computation efficiency. Despite the encouraging progress, the computation cost is still too high for practical applications. This work represents the first step to effectively prune privacy-preserving deep learning models to reduce computation complexity. Although model pruning has been discussed extensively in the machine learning community, directly applying the plaintext model pruning schemes offers little help to reduce the computation in privacy-preserving models. In this paper we propose Hunter, a structured pruning method that identifies three novel HE-friendly structures, i.e., internal structure, external structure, and weight diagonal to guide the pruning process. Hunter outputs a pruned model that, without any loss in model accuracy, achieves a significant reduction in HE operations (and thus the overall computation cost) in the privacy-preserving MLaaS. We apply Hunter in various deep learning models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG and ResNet over classic datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The experimental results demonstrate that, without accuracy loss, Hunter efficiently prunes the original networks to reduce the HE Perm, Mult, and Add operations. For example, in the state-of-the-art VGG-16 on ImageNet with 10 chosen classes, the total number of Perm is reduced to as low as 2% of the original network, and at the same time, Mult and Add are reduced to only 14%, enabling a significantly more computation-efficient privacy-preserving MLaaS.},

However, gaps in security and scalability hinder the development of real-world applications. In this study, we propose ScaleSFL, which is a scalable blockchain-based sharding solution for federated learning. ScaleSFL supports interoperability by separating the off-chain federated learning component in order to verify model updates instead of controlling the entire federated learning flow. We implemented ScaleSFL as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate the feasibility of the solution. We present a performance evaluation of results collected through Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tools conducted on model creation. Our evaluation results show that sharding can improve validation performance linearly while remaining efficient and secure.},

When smart grids and smart meters calculate and report the power usage of a customer to a utility provider in a user friendly way, we need to ensure that privacy of the customers is not violated and no sensitive data such as their energy consumption habits are revealed either to the utility provider or to third parties, trusted or otherwise. To this end, we propose a novel scheme to compute electricity usage of customers and report it to a utility provider in a secure manner, using cryptographic primitives such as secret sharing, aggregate signatures, and a distributed file system for data storage and retrieval. Using our proposed system, a utility provider can accurately bill a customer for their energy consumption, without having to know the customer's energy usage habits, and without having to rely on trusted hardware or a trusted third party.},

abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is the de-facto standard in-vehicle network system. Despite its wide adoption by automobile manufacturers, the lack of security design makes it vulnerable to attacks. For instance, broadcasting packets without authentication allows the impersonation of electronic control units (ECUs). Prior mitigations, such as message authentication or intrusion detection systems, fail to address the compatibility requirement with legacy ECUs, stealthy and sporadic malicious messaging, or guaranteed attack detection. We propose a novel authentication system called ShadowAuth that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by offering backwardcompatible packet authentication to ECUs without requiring ECU firmware source code. Specifically, our authentication scheme provides transparent CAN packet authentication without modifying existing CAN packet definitions (e.g., J1939) via automatic ECU firmware instrumentation technique to locate CAN packet transmission code, and instrument authentication code based on the CAN packet behavioral transmission patterns. ShadowAuth enables vehicles to detect state-of-the-art CAN attacks, such as busoff and packet injection, responsively within 60ms without false positives. ShadowAuth provides a sound and deployable solution for real-world ECUs.},

PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due to its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the unfairness issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have investigated 2,500+ in the wild projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two types of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level (a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering) fairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-profitable sealer assumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the forked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the attacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021), the potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to 681,087 million USD. Besides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and accordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix. To the best of knowledge, this work provides the first exploration of the unfairness issue in PoA algorithms.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been shown vulnerable to a new class of adversarial attacks, known as model poisoning attacks (MPA), where one or more malicious clients try to poison the global model by sending carefully crafted local model updates to the central parameter server. Existing defenses that have been fixated on analyzing model parameters show limited effectiveness in detecting such carefully crafted poisonous models. In this work, we propose FLARE, a robust model aggregation mechanism for FL, which is resilient against state-of-the-art MPAs. Instead of solely depending on model parameters, FLARE leverages the penultimate layer representations (PLRs) of the model for characterizing the adversarial influence on each local model update. PLRs demonstrate a better capability to differentiate malicious models from benign ones than model parameter-based solutions. We further propose a trust evaluation method that estimates a trust score for each model update based on pairwise PLR discrepancies among all model updates. Under the assumption that honest clients make up the majority, FLARE assigns a trust score to each model update in a way that those far from the benign cluster are assigned low scores. FLARE then aggregates the model updates weighted by their trust scores and finally updates the global model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE in defending FL against various MPAs, including semantic backdoor attacks, trojan backdoor attacks, and untargeted attacks, and safeguarding the accuracy of FL.},

abstract = {A distributed and reliable source of randomness is always a critical element in cryptography, both in the construction and application of cryptographic primitives. Modern cryptography such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance is heavily dependent on a trusted randomness source. In particular, Decentralized Randomness Beacon (DRB) protocols can be a reliable source of randomness. A DRB protocol generates a continuous stream of publicly verifiable random values. Almost all the available DRB protocols are collaborative in nature where participants of a DRB protocol collaborate their local entropy to generate global randomness.A DRB protocol can also be competitive where the participants compete to generate the global randomness. RANDCHAIN (ePrint 2020/1033) is the first Competitive Decentralized Randomness Beacon Protocol. Although RANDCHAIN claims to provide fairness and scalability, it still has a few problems concerning blockchain-oriented attacks and fairness to the participants. Therefore, to solve the existing problems of RANDCHAIN, we present a general model to construct competitive DRB protocols. Our competitive DRB model is a composition of committee selection strategy followed by a moderately hard cryptographic puzzle. To provide different levels of fairness, we present a variety of committee selection strategies. Our competitive DRB protocols provide better fairness, linear communication complexity, and better scalability compared to the existing DRB protocols.},

Using the MatHEAAN we developed a deep sequential model with a gated recurrent unit called MatHEGRU. We evaluated the proposed model using sequence modeling, regression, and classification of images and genome sequences. We show that the hidden states of the encrypted model, as well as the results, are consistent with a plaintext model.},

abstract = {Biometric databases collect people's information and allow users to perform proximity searches (finding all records within a bounded distance of the query point) with few cryptographic protections. This work studies proximity searchable encryption applied to the iris biometric.Prior work proposed inner product functional encryption as a technique to build proximity biometric databases (Kim et al., SCN 2018). This is because binary Hamming distance is computable using an inner product. This work identifies and closes two gaps to using inner product encryption for biometric search: Biometrics naturally use long vectors often with thousands of bits. Many inner product encryption schemes generate a random matrix whose dimension scales with vector size and have to invert this matrix. As a result, setup is not feasible on commodity hardware unless we reduce the dimension of the vectors. We explore state of the art techniques to reduce the dimension of the iris biometric and show that all known techniques harm the accuracy of the resulting system. That is, for small vector sizes multiple unrelated biometrics are returned in the search. For length 64 vectors, at a 90% probability of the searched biometric being returned, 10% of stored records are erroneously returned on average. Rather than changing the feature extractor, we introduce a new cryptographic technique that allows one to generate several smaller matrices. For vectors of length 1024 this reduces time to run setup from 23 days to 4 minutes. At this vector length, for the same $90%$ probability of the searched biometric being returned, .02% of stored records are erroneously returned on average. Prior inner product approaches leak distance between the query and all stored records. We refer to these as distance-revealing. We show a natural construction from function hiding, secret-key, predicate, inner product encryption (Shen, Shi, and Waters, TCC 2009). Our construction only leaks access patterns, and which returned records are the same distance from the query. We refer to this scheme as distance-hiding. We implement and benchmark one distance-revealing and one distance-hiding scheme. The distance-revealing scheme can search a small (hundreds) database in 4 minutes while the distance-hiding scheme is not yet practical, requiring 3.5 hours.},

abstract = {We consider a setting of two-party computation between a server and a client where every message received by the server is encrypted by a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and its decryption key is held by the client only. Akavia and Vald (IACR ePrint Archive, 2021) revisited the privacy problem in such protocols against malicious servers and revealed (as opposed to a naive expectation) that under certain condition, a malicious server can recover the client's input even if the underlying FHE scheme is IND-CPA secure. They also gave some sufficient conditions for the FHE scheme to ensure the privacy against malicious servers. However, their argument did not consider the possibility that a query from a malicious server to a client involves an invalid ciphertext. In this paper, we show, by giving a concrete example, that if such an invalid query is just rejected by the client, then the sufficient conditions in Akavia and Vald's result do not in general ensure the privacy against malicious servers. We also propose another option to handle an invalid query in a way that the client returns a random ciphertext (without explicitly rejecting the query), and show that such a protocol is private against malicious servers if the underlying FHE scheme is IND-CPA secure, sanitizable (in the sense of Ducas and Stehl\'{e}, EUROCRYPT 2016), and circular secure.},

abstract = {Dynamic program analysis is commonly used to vet Android applications. One approach is targeted execution, in which interesting or suspicious code is specifically targeted and analyzed dynamically. However, faithful execution to just the paths that reach these targets can be difficult due to the dependencies they have on other parts of the application. Prior works that handle dependencies must favor either soundness or completeness to the detriment of the other. Techniques that rely on precise dependency tracking ultimately result in lower coverage of targets due to overhead. Meanwhile, other techniques that aim for completeness by ignoring or bypassing dependencies lead to unsound execution and false positives. In this paper, we treat dependencies through the lens of a path context, which represents the program state expected by the path as it is executing. We propose an approach that provides better completeness and low false positives using Context Approximation and Refinement (CAR), which combines static constraint analysis and dynamic error recovery to infer a context based on the desired path flow and refine it during execution. We show that the integration of CAR with targeted execution can reach 3.1x more target locations in popular Android applications than the existing state of the art while having a false detection rate of 9%, enabling more complete analysis and detection of security-sensitive behaviors.},

abstract = {Private set intersection (PSI) protocols allow a set of mutually distrustful parties, each holding a private set of items, to compute the intersection over all their sets, such that no other information is revealed. PSI has a wide variety of applications including online advertising (e.g., efficacy computation), security (e.g., botnet detection, intrusion detection), proximity testing (e.g., COVID-19 contact tracing), and more. Private set intersection is a rapidly developing area and there exist many highly efficient protocols. However, almost all of these protocols are for the case of two parties or for semi-honest security. In particular, despite the high interest in this problem, prior to our work there has been no concretely efficient, maliciously secure multiparty PSI protocol.We present PSImple, the first concretely efficient maliciously-secure multiparty PSI protocol. Our construction is based on oblivious transfer and garbled Bloom filters, and has a round-optimal online phase. To demonstrate the practicality of PSImple, we implemented it and ran experiments with up to 32 parties and 2 20 inputs. We show that PSImple is competitive even with the state-of-the-art concretely efficient semi-honest multiparty PSI protocols.Additionally, we revisit the garbled Bloom filter parameters used in the 2-party PSI protocol of Rindal and Rosulek (Eurocrypt 2017). Using a more careful analysis, we show that the size of the garbled Bloom filters and the number of oblivious transfers required for malicious security can be significantly reduced, often by more than 20%. These improved parameters also imply a better security guarantee, and can be used both in the 2-party PSI protocol of Rindal and Rosulek and in i&gt;PSImple.},

abstract = {The classification service over a stream of data is becoming an important offering for cloud providers, but users may encounter obstacles in providing sensitive data due to privacy concerns. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are promising solutions for protecting private data, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks induced by data-dependent access patterns. We propose a Privacy-preserving Data Stream Training and Inference scheme, called EnclaveTree, that provides confidentiality for user's data and the target models against a compromised cloud service provider. We design a matrix-based training and inference procedure to train the Hoeffding Tree (HT) model and perform inference with the trained model inside the trusted area of TEEs, which provably prevent the exploitation of access-pattern-based attacks. The performance evaluation shows that EnclaveTree is practical for processing the data streams with small or medium number of features. When there are less than 63 binary features,EnclaveTree is up to ~10x and ~9 faster than na\"{\i}ve oblivious solution on training and inference, respectively.},

abstract = {Online services that provide books, music, movies, etc., for free have existed on the Internet for decades. While there are some common beliefs and warnings that such online services may contain hidden security risks, many ordinary users still visit such websites, making them a convenient vehicle for subsequent exploitation. In this paper, we investigate and quantify through measurements the potential vulnerability of such free content websites (FCWs). For this purpose, we curated 834 FCWs offering books, games, movies, music, and software. For a comparison purpose, we also sampled a comparable number of premium content websites, where users need to pay for using the service for the same type of content. For our modality of analysis, we use SSL certificates. Namely, we explore SSL certificates' structural and fundamental differences between free and premium content websites. Through our analysis, we unveil that 36% of the free websites' certificates have major issues, with 17% invalid certificates, 7% expired, and 12% with mismatched domain names. Moreover, although surprisingly, we uncover the usage of ECDSA predominantly among the free websites. Among other observations, we notice that 38% of the FCWs use ECDSA-256, compared to only 20% of their premium counterparts, which provides better security guarantees (and performance) than the common algorithm option and key size (RSA-2048) in premium websites. Our observations raise concerns regarding the safety of using such free services from a transport standpoint and call for in-depth analysis of their risks.},

abstract = {Adversarial training has recently emerged as an important defense mechanism to robustify machine learning models in the presence adversarial examples. Although adversarial training can boost the robustness of machine learning algorithms by a margin, research has not been conducted to determine if adversarial training is effective in the long-term. As deployments of machine learning algorithms are characterized by dynamics, change of the underlying model is inevitable. The dynamics are a result of model's evolution over time by introducing new training data and drifting the model by changing its parameters. In this paper, we examine the limitations of adversarial training due to the temporal changes of machine learning models. Using a natural language task, we conduct various experiments using a variety of datasets to measure the impact of concept drift on the efficacy of adversarial training. In particular, our analysis shows that certain adversarially-trained models are even more prone to the drift than others. In particular, WordCNN and LSTM-based models are shown more susceptible to the temporal changes than others such as BERT. We validate our findings using multiple real-world datasets on different network architectures. Our work calls for further research into the temporal aspects of adversarial training.},
